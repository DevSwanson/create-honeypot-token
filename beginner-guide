First, before you do anything to create token, you need to know what token creation is about. People usually create crypto tokens to monetize their ideas, or just purely for funs, and for many other reasons. In order to make those crypto tokens working, you need to understand what Token Planning is about.

 

 

Token Planning:

 

-What is the idea/concept of  your token? Is it is a meme coin? Is it a Dog-themed coin? Is it a Cat-themed coin or Elon-themed coin or maybe just anything. Do you need a website for it? Do you need social media profiles on your tokens? Do you need other profiles on your tokens?

-How you are going to do all these stuffs?

 

Answer: It is possible to do it alone, but will recommend you to form your own team because doing all these setups and token stuffs alone are really time-consuming and hectic. You can find team members from your friends, families, internet friends, or just join some crypto communities (telegram group or other social media) to find like-minded people to be your team member.

 

 

 

If you feel those information is overloaded, take it slow, read some information little by little, day by day. Most important thing is you need to take actions by starting to actually doing those stuffs in order to get a clue and learning even more from doing the real stuffs. Nothing is easy.
